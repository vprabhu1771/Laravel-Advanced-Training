Next, define a route in your routes/web.php file:

// routes/web.php

use App\Http\Controllers\InvoiceController;

Route::get('/generate-invoice', [InvoiceController::class, 'generateInvoice']);


This route will map the URL /generate-invoice to the generateInvoice method in the InvoiceController. You can change the URL and method name according to your preferences and naming conventions.

After defining the route, you can access the invoice generation page by visiting the specified URL in your browser. For example, if you're running your Laravel application locally, 

you can access the invoice generation page at http://localhost:8000/generate-invoice.

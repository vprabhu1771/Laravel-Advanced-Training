When using the local driver, all file operations are relative to the root directory defined in your filesystems configuration file. By default, this value is set to the storage/app directory. Therefore, the following method would write to storage/app/example.txt:

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;
 
Storage::disk('local')->put('example.txt', 'Contents');

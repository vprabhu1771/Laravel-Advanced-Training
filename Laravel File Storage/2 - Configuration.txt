Laravel's filesystem configuration file is located at config/filesystems.php. Within this file, you may configure all of your filesystem "disks". Each disk represents a particular storage driver and storage location. Example configurations for each supported driver are included in the configuration file so you can modify the configuration to reflect your storage preferences and credentials.

The local driver interacts with files stored locally on the server running the Laravel application while the s3 driver is used to write to Amazon's S3 cloud storage service.

Note:

You may configure as many disks as you like and may even have multiple disks that use the same driver.

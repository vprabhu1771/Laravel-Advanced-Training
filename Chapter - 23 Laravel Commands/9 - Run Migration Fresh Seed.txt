In Laravel, both `php artisan migrate:fresh` and `php artisan migrate:refresh` are commands used to reset and re-run all database migrations. However, there are subtle differences between the two:

1. **`php artisan migrate:fresh`:**
   - This command drops all tables from the database and then re-runs all migrations. It effectively resets the entire database.
   - It's equivalent to running `php artisan migrate:reset` followed by `php artisan migrate`.


   php artisan migrate:fresh


2. **`php artisan migrate:refresh`:**
   - This command rolls back all migrations and then re-runs them. It's useful when you want to refresh the database but keep some data (seeded data) intact.
   - It's equivalent to running `php artisan migrate:reset` followed by `php artisan migrate --seed`.


   php artisan migrate:refresh


In summary, if you want to completely reset the database and start from scratch, use `migrate:fresh`. If you want to refresh the database but retain seeded data, use `migrate:refresh`.

Here's an example of using `migrate:refresh` with seeding:


php artisan migrate:refresh --seed


This command will roll back all migrations, re-run them, and then seed the database with the specified seeders.


php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

In Laravel, you can clear various caches using the Artisan command-line tool. Here are some common cache-related commands:

1. **Clear Application Cache:**

   php artisan cache:clear


2. **Clear Configuration Cache:**

   php artisan config:clear


3. **Clear Route Cache:**

   php artisan route:clear


4. **Clear Compiled View Files:**

   php artisan view:clear


5. **Clear All Caches (Application, Configuration, Route, and View):**

   php artisan clear


Make sure to run these commands from the root directory of your Laravel project using the terminal or command prompt. These commands will help you clear various caches that Laravel uses for optimization.

Additionally, if you are using an opcode cache like OPCache, you might need to restart your web server or PHP-FPM to clear that cache as well.

Remember that clearing caches might cause a temporary performance hit as Laravel rebuilds the necessary caches when the application is accessed again.

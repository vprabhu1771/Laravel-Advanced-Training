You can get the previous year using Carbon by subtracting a year from the current date. Here's how you can do it:


use Carbon\Carbon;

$currentYear = Carbon::now()->year;
$previousYear = Carbon::now()->subYear()->year;

echo "Current year: " . $currentYear . "\n";
echo "Previous year: " . $previousYear;


This code will output both the current year and the previous year.

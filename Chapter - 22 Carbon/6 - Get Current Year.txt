In Laravel, you can use Carbon, a powerful library for handling dates and times, to easily get the current year. Here's how you can do it:


use Carbon\Carbon;

$currentYear = Carbon::now()->year;

echo "Current year: " . $currentYear;


This code snippet will output the current year. `Carbon::now()` creates a new Carbon instance representing the current date and time, and then `->year` retrieves the year component of that instance.

To calculate the next day from yesterday using Carbon, you can do the following:


use Carbon\Carbon;

$yesterday = Carbon::yesterday();
$nextDay = $yesterday->addDay();

echo $nextDay->toDateString();


This code snippet will output the date for the day after yesterday. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. `Carbon::yesterday()` gets yesterday's date.

2. `$yesterday->addDay()` adds one day to yesterday's date to get the next day.

3. `->toDateString()` converts the Carbon instance to a string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

To get the next year using Carbon, you can use the `addYear()` method. Here's how you can do it:

use Carbon\Carbon;

$currentYear = Carbon::now()->year;
$nextYear = Carbon::now()->addYear()->year;

echo "Current year: " . $currentYear . "\n";
echo "Next year: " . $nextYear;


This will output the current year and the next year.

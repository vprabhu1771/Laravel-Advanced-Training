To pass both `$categories` and `$cities` variables globally so they're accessible in `header.blade.php`, you can follow the same approach used for `$categories`. Hereâ€™s how to update each solution to include both variables:

### Solution 1: Use Service Provider for Global Variables

1. Open `AppServiceProvider.php` in `app/Providers`.
2. Modify the `boot` method to share both `$categories` and `$cities` with all views.

```php
use App\Models\Category;
use App\Models\City;

public function boot()
{
    // Share categories and cities with all views
    view()->share('categories', Category::all());
    view()->share('cities', City::all());
}
```

### Solution 2: Pass `$categories` and `$cities` in Specific Controller Methods

Ensure each controller method that renders a view needing `header.blade.php` also passes both `$categories` and `$cities`.

```php
public function someOtherMethod()
{
    $categories = Category::all();
    $cities = City::all();

    return view('frontend.some_view', compact('categories', 'cities'));
}
```

### Solution 3: Use View Composer for Specific Views

If you want to load `$categories` and `$cities` only for the `header.blade.php`, you can use a view composer:

1. Open `AppServiceProvider.php` and modify the `boot` method to include both variables.

```php
use App\Models\Category;
use App\Models\City;

public function boot()
{
    // Bind categories and cities to the header view only
    view()->composer('frontend.layout.header', function ($view) {
        $view->with('categories', Category::all());
        $view->with('cities', City::all());
    });
}
```

### Clear Cache if Necessary

If you still see the error after making these changes, clear the view and configuration caches:

```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

Any of these methods will make both `$categories` and `$cities` accessible in `header.blade.php` without needing to pass them individually in each controller method.

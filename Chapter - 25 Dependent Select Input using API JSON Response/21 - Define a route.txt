Define a route in your web.php or api.php file:

use App\Http\Controllers\CityController;

Route::get('/find-state-country/{city}', [CityController::class, 'findStateAndCountryByCity']);


Replace 'YourController' with the actual name of your controller.

Now, when you access the URL like /find-state-country/{city}, it will return the city, state, and country associated with the given city. 

Make sure to replace the placeholder {city} with the actual city name you want to search for.

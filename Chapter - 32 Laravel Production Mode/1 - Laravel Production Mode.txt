In Laravel, you can set the application environment to production by modifying the `.env` file. The `.env` file is located at the root of your Laravel project and contains configuration settings for your application.

To enable production mode, you can set the `APP_ENV` variable in the `.env` file to "production". Here's an example:


APP_ENV=production


Make sure to save the changes to the `.env` file after making this modification.

Additionally, it's a good practice to set the `APP_DEBUG` variable to false in the production environment to disable detailed error messages and enhance security. Here's an example:


APP_DEBUG=false


After making these changes, your Laravel application should be running in production mode.

Remember to clear the configuration cache using the following Artisan command to apply the changes:


php artisan config:cache


And if your application uses any caching mechanisms, you might also need to clear those caches:


php artisan cache:clear


These commands help ensure that the updated configuration is loaded by the application.
